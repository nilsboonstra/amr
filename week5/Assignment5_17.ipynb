    "# Introduction\n",
    "Knowledge of the location of a platform is essential for a lot of robotics applications. Assignement 3 demonstrated how to acquire a more abstract representation of linear structures perceived with a scanning range finder. This exercise will show that -given a map of the linear features in this representation- the robot can localize itself based on the linear structures it perceives. This exercise closely follows the example given in [p. 331-342]. We $\\textbf{strongly}$ advice you to read the respective pages before starting with the exercise.\n",
